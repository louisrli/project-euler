## 46 until _ (Scala, 07/2012)
This set was started on July 2012. They are Scala packages and not Scala scripts. The package is mostly a convenience for a Project Euler application runner that makes things print prettily.

**Location**: src/euler/solutions.
For reading convenience, the files are copied to the top-level directory (symlinks don't work). I've always had trouble reading through Java packages on Github, so I thought I'd save the pain. Note that `src/euler/solutions/*.scala` will run, but the top-level files won't!

## 1 to 45 (C++, 12/2011 - 01/2012)
These are included so that the solutions are complete, but I'm stashing them away in the archives/ folder. These solutions (mostly) treat C++ as a procedural language and reinvent the wheel in a few cases (for learning purposes).
