## 46 until _
Solutions are in Scala. This set was started on July 2012. They are Scala packages and not Scala scripts. The package is mostly a convenience for a Project Euler application runner that makes things print prettily.

*Location*: src/euler/solutions. For reading convenience, the files are copied to the top-level directory (symlinks don't work). I've always had trouble reading through Java packages on Github, so I thought I'd save the pain. Note that `src/euler/solutions/*.scala` will run, but the top-level files won't!

## 1 to 45
Solutions are in C++ (December 2011 - January 2012). They're included in here so that the solutions are complete, but I'm stashing them away in the archives/ folder. These solutions (mostly) treat C++ as a procedural language and reinvent the wheel in a few cases (for learning purposes).
